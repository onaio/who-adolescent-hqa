# Developing an electronic tool to evaluate/review/assess the quality – including the friendliness – of health services, building on WHO’s tried and tested ‘paper’ tool.

Dates: December 4th, 2013 – February 4th  2014

## Rationale

A growing number of countries are using WHO’s recommended standards-driven quality improvement (SDQI) approach to improve the quality – including the friendliness of health services for adolescents.

The SDQI approach includes three steps – defining quality, assessing quality and improving quality. Many countries have developed national quality standards using WHO’s tool: Making health services adolescent friendly: Developing national quality standards for Adolescent Friendly Health Services. (Reference 1) They have also adapted and used WHO’s Quality Assessment Guidebook. (Reference 2)

Because this involves gathering and analyzing data on paper forms, the evaluation/review/assessment exercise is a slow and laborious process. From discussions with policy makers and programme managers, it appears that more assessments are not being done because the process is difficult, time consuming and requires specialized expertise.
Formhub is a free, online platform exists which enables data to be collected digitally in a more timely and accurate manner than with traditional paper instruments.  Users can author and administer forms and data is collected and available for analysis via a secure, password-protected site.  Forms can be accessed on or offline and can be built to include environmental data (such as GPS coordinates and photos), which may be informative to those conducting assessments.
Developing an electronic version of the Quality Assessment Guidebook using formhub will enable quality evaluations/reviews/assessments to be less difficult and less time consuming than they currently are.  The open source nature of the platform will make this digitalized tool readily available to the wide range of countries already implementing the tool.

## Scope of Work:

The two areas of focus in this consultancy are: 1) to develop a prototype system that will allow for digital collection of the quality assessment forms via web forms and mobile smart phones, and 2) to develop a password-protected website for users of the Guidebook, which will automatically calculate the scores for the various adolescent health characteristics of assessed clinics in an easy-to-use reporting interface.

**Area 1** focuses on: a prototype system for data collection.  The system will be designed with the anticipated primary user being a health facility manager conducting an assessment of their own health facility.  The system will allow for online or offline data collection on a wide variety of devices, ranging from smartphones which primary users may have for personal use, to low grade laptops or desktops which may be available in the health facility.  The system will be able to support multiple language versions of the tool, with English and Spanish being immediately available.

**Area 2** focuses on: a preliminary mechanism for providing rapid analysis and calculated scores for adolescent health service quality characteristics.  End users of the site will be able to register with the site and register health facilities they want to do to the quality assessment on.   The system will generate a unique code for each health facility that would be used in quality assessment forms.  Users will be able to select the characteristic(s) they wish to assess and will be provided with the appropriate digital forms and questions required to measure these characteristics.  After data has been collected, the site will automatically calculate the scores for all of the selected 20 different adolescent health characteristics, using the WHO provided scoring methods, for each of the clinics in an easy-to-use report format.  Feedback can include the score range and action points to improve care.  This website will serve as the foundation for an eventual application which will allow for the same level of analysis offline.

## Deliverables:

The scope of work will include three major deliverables, enumerated below:

* Form Digitization - Conversion of the following tools into the XLSForm format for mobile and web based data collection via formhub.
* Adolescent client interview tool
* Health-care provider interview tool
* Support staff interview tool
* Health facility manager interview tool
* Outreach worker interview tool
* Community member interview tool
* Adolescent-in-community tool
* Observation guide

The forms will be programmed with skip logic and form validation to ensure data collected at the source is done properly avoiding data quality issues in the future.  Spanish and English versions will be included.  The development of these forms will result in electronic versions of the quality assessment guide, providing the content foundation of the prototype system for data collection, defined as the first work area.

**Mobile and Web based Data Collection**

Users will be able to capture data via an Android phone or tablet using ODK Collect.  Users will be able to also use mobile enabled webforms to capture the data via using any web browser including ones on an iphone, ipad, laptop, desktop or any other device with a modern browser.   Both systems will provide the ability for end users to capture data on their devices when they are offline for later submission when they have connectivity.  Enabling mobile and web-based data collection for the developed digitalized forms will complete the quality assessment guide’s prototype system for data collection (the first work area).

**Adolescent Health Quality Assessment Website**

The development of the adolescent health QA Website will result in a secure, online data collection and analysis resource for users of the Guidebook, and will fulfill the second area of work.  To ensure that the website meets the requirements detailed in the scope of work above, the developed site will have four major components:

1. User and Quality Assessment  Project Registration - Users will have the ability to register themselves with the site to conduct a QA project.

2. Health facility registration - Once having registered a QA Project, the user will be prompted to register into the system the health facilities they want to register.  Upon registration a short unique code will be generated for each facility for use when completing the QA assessment forms.  The health facility registration form will also be made available on the phone client so health facilities could be registered (with a GPS point, photo, etc) directly from the field.  The system will provide the ability to print out a simple listing of the name of the clinics and associated code for use of the field based staff when collecting data.

3. Characteristic scoring - The system will be programmed to be able to automatically calculate the 20 adolescent health characteristics for each facility using the scoring methods provided in the WHO Quality Assessment Guidebook.   The system will generate the scores based on what QA Forms have been completed.  A very simple interface will be provided to allow the user to view the scores in a report view for each of the different facilities and their group averages.  The data will be formatted in a way that looks good when printed.  That way the end user can take printouts when going back to the health facilities and communities to review the results.

4. Data Exporting - The user will be able to download via .csv representing both the raw submissions and calculated scores via the site.  To edit submissions, the user will be able to user their login into Formhub to view their submission data and make edits from there.
